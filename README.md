# CovidFakenewsDetector
An ML based project that detects if the entered Covid news is hoax or legitimate by using NLP techniques.

INTRODUCTION: 

To determine the authenticity of given Covid related news.

OBJECTIVE: 
To identify the given news as True or False with an accuracy score.

DESCRIPTION: 
Social media based Covid news for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of "fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineffective or not applicable. Thus this project uses NLP techniques for identifying the various hoax news and the legitimate news with an accuracy score.
